This directory contains two examples of foreign-language extensions.

	# dlltest.dll
	Simple code illustrating very basic functionality of the
	interface.  Load it using:

		?- load_foreign_library(dlltest).

	It defines the following predicates:

		say_hello(+Text)
			Shows a simple Windows message-box containing
			Text.
		mclock(-MilliSeconds)
			Return the number of milli-seconds elapsed since
			the library was loaded.
		rlc_color(+Which, +R, +G, +B)
			Set the color of the plwin window. Which is one
			of {window, text, highlight, highlighttext}, RGB
			are integers between 0 and 255 for the color
			components.

	In addition, it illustrates how to hook into a Prolog abort.

	# plregtry.dll
	Defines predicates to access the Windows registry.  It is a much
	more elaborate example, and also a useful library. Its not
	documented, but with some knowledge of the Windows API it should
	be fairly easy to figure out how it works.

The .dsp files are Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 project files. Basically, to
compile them:

	* Ensure the compile has the SWI-Prolog include directory		in the search-path for header-files.
	
	* Ensure the compiler has the SWI-Prolog lib directory in
	the search-path for libraries.

	* Ensure WIN32 is a defined symbol (-DWIN32).  MSVC normally
	defines this for you.
